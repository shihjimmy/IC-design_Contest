# IC-design_Contest
> This repo contains all my self-practice cell-based IC Design Contest code.  
> All the code in each folder can pass the highest level.  
> Sometimes the highest level is labeled as "S", while sometimes is labeled as "A".   
> If you are interested in my design, please check out each folder for more imformation.

## Graduate level 
- 2016 Local Binary Patterns
  > Pass level A with area x time = 5214.4 x 571560 = 2.98e9 ("A" level grading must under 12e9)  
- 2018 Huffman Coding
  > Pass level A with all patterns passed
- 2019 Image Convolution Circuit Design
  > Pass level S with area = 25,626 ("S" level grading must under 270,000)    
- 2020 String Matching Engine
  > Pass level A with score = 100  
- 2021 Geofence  
  > Pass level A with area = 39412 ("A" level grading must under 110000)
